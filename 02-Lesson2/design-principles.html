        <p>
          The Built by Buffalo website does an exquisite job of using contrast, among other phenomenal design elements, to create a dynamic and inviting website.  When initially landing on the website, the viewer is greeted with a soft white-grey background that is strongly contrasted by the black of the logo, headline, and paragraph content.  This simple use of black and white provides an excellent example of how contrast can create bold websites when it is implemented as a design principle.

          <p>
            Etch Apps has created an inviting website site that utilizes the design element of repetition in its color pallet.  The base color of purple is repeated in two shades throughout the design.  The deep purple background at the bottom of the page is repeated in the headline font color, and in the pant color of the three men. The lighter shade of pupils appears as the background of the upper part of the page and is again repeated in the font colors of the text appearing on the lower half of the page on the dark purple.  The third repeating color, a melon orange, not only repeated in key design images such as the logo, the men's shirts, and the lower icons, but it also provides an excellent example of contrast.
